# AngularChildComponentTemplates

This demonstrates how to create a component that can have nested components
which can be used as templates for the parent component creating a cascading
effect.

```
Parent
  -> Child
    -> Parent (child)
      -> Child (child)
        -> And so on and so forth...
```

There will be more updates to this repo because I need it to do a little more. I
need this sort of relationship for a component set that asks yes/no questions
and the response determines the next set of questions to ask.
